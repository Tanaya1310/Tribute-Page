<h2>A brief summary of BTS's journey</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>
    BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, 
    is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010 and debuting in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
    The septet—consisting of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. 
    Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental 
    health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love,and individualism. Their work also 
    frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

    V (뷔) :" vocalist<br>
    Jungkook (정국) : vocalist<br>
</p>
<h3>Musical style</h3>
<p>
    Since their inception, BTS have emphasized hip hop as their musical base, largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers;
    during visits to the US, the group has received mentoring from American rappers.[288] Bang Si-hyuk previously acknowledged that K-pop as a whole draws from black music,
    and author Crystal S. Anderson noted,"BTS's rising popularity in the US represents the continuation of the ways that K-pop functions as part of a global R&B tradition."
    <br>
    Since their formation, BTS have believed that telling their own stories is the best way for the younger generation to relate to their music.
     Writing many of their own lyrics,[300][301] the group discusses universal life experiences such as sadness and loneliness in their work and turn them into 
     something lighter and more manageable. RM said that BTS tries to avoid a preaching or reprimanding tone in their songs "because that's not the way that we want 
     to spread our message ... We're born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, the real meaning of it,
    starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start."
</p>
<h3>Fandom</h3>
<p>
    BTS' rise was facilitated by a great increase in music video programming and consumption on YouTube and the coming of an idol empire, 
    including merchandising of nonmusical products, games, and fantasy fiction, as well as an expansion of online music fandom. The group has a large, 
    highly organized, online community of fans, known as ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), which translates the group's lyrics and social media 
    posts into other languages and matches charitable contributions of BTS' members. As of 2020, some 40 million ARMY members subscribe to the band's YouTube channel, 
    with more than 30 million following the official BTS Twitter and Instagram accounts. The fan community helps generate BTS' number-one chart rankings via 
    coordinated campaigns on streaming platforms, as well as pushes to feature BTS' music on radio stations and television.
    <br>
    the relationship between BTS and ARMY is "a mutual exchange between artists and their fans" that is about more than merely "ensuring the band's primacy", 
    but also "extending the band's message of positivity into the world". Lee opines that BTS and ARMY are "a symbol of change in zeitgeist, not just of generational 
    change". The band members themselves agree and have long acknowledged their fans' role in their success.[355] According to Sarah Keith, 
    "BTS embody a moment of generational transformation. ARMY represents a 'coming of age' for the young, 
    in which cultural production and influence are global and meaningful, and where the youth are politically and socially engaged."
